            information, by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the Platform. We may track your
            buying behaviour, preferences, and other information that you choose to provide on our Platform. We use this
            information to do research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and
            serve our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information may

We will occasionally ask you to complete surveys conducted either by us or through a third- party market research agency. These surveys may ask you for personal information, contact information, gender, date of birth, demographic information (like pin code, age or income level) attributes such as your interests, household or lifestyle information, your purchasing behaviour or history preference and other such information that you may choose to provide. The survey may involve collection of voice data or video recordings. Participation in these surveys are purely voluntary in nature. We use this data to tailor your experience at our Platform, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in and to display content according to your preferences.
