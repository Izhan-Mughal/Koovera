            ask you for personal information, contact information, gender, date of birth, demographic information (like
            pin code, age or income level) attributes such as your interests, household or lifestyle information, your
            purchasing behaviour or history preference and other such information that you may choose to provide. The
            survey may involve collection of voice data or video recordings. Participation in these surveys are purely
            voluntary in nature. We use this data to tailor your experience at our Platform, providing you with content
            that we think you might be interested in and to display content according to your preferences.

            provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that
            they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to

            reasonable security practices and procedures, in line with international standards ISO/IEC 27001:2013 which

            remain certain inherent risks regarding use of the Platform. Users are responsible for ensuring the
